Creating a battle ship game to learn...
- Python
- Javascript
- Html
- Restful apis, using Flask
- Web sockets

To use it, run the battleship.bat (in Windows).

On browsers go to the url that Flask says.

To do:
- get a web server, using Flask... which also lets you browse the code base
- when you change the html/js you need to force a refresh from the brower
