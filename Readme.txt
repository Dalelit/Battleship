Creating a battle ship game to learn...
- Python
- Javascript
- Html
- Restful apis, using Flask
- Web sockets

To use it, run the battleship.bat (in Windows).

On browsers go to the url that Flask says /battleship.html

To do:
- Get a web server. Currently using Flask... which also lets you browse the code base (nice feature!)
- Work out if/how to have Flask APIs and the webSockets working off the same config, but in different programs
    - maybe use?... https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
    - Should add some graceful exiting
- When you change the html/js you need to force a refresh from the brower
- Comment the code and re-org it
